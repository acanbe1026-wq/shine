# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## What Was Done

### 1. Package Analysis
- Verified that `@vercel/analytics` (v1.6.1) was already present in package.json dependencies
- Identified this as a Next.js App Router project (using src/app directory structure)

### 2. Import Path Update
**Modified:** `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Changed the Analytics import from `@vercel/analytics/react` to `@vercel/analytics/next`
- This is the recommended import path for Next.js projects as per Vercel documentation
- The Analytics component was already correctly placed inside the <body> tag after the main content

### 3. Dependency Installation
- Ran `npm install` to ensure all dependencies (including @vercel/analytics) are properly installed
- Updated package-lock.json to reflect the current dependency tree

### 4. Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
- ✅ All 10 pages generated without errors
- ✅ Linter executed (pre-existing warnings in other files, none from Analytics changes)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- No test suite was available to run

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component is correctly positioned in the root layout file:
```tsx
<body>
  <MantineProvider>
    <ChannelService />
    <main>{children}</main>
    <Analytics />  // ← Vercel Analytics component
  </MantineProvider>
</body>
```

This placement ensures analytics tracking across all pages in the application.

## Files Changed
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Updated Analytics import path
- `package-lock.json` - Updated after running npm install

## Notes
- The project already had the Analytics component integrated but was using the React-specific import
- Updated to use the Next.js-specific import path which provides better integration with Next.js features
- Analytics will now track page views and web vitals across the entire application
- No environment variables or additional configuration required for basic analytics
