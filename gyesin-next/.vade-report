Vercel Web Analytics Configuration Update

## Summary
Updated the Vercel Web Analytics implementation to use the correct Next.js-specific import path.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **src/app/layout.tsx**: Updated Analytics import from `@vercel/analytics/react` to `@vercel/analytics/next`

### Context:
The project already had Vercel Web Analytics installed and configured:
- Package `@vercel/analytics` version 1.6.1 was already present in package.json
- The `<Analytics />` component was already properly placed in the root layout inside the `<body>` tag
- However, it was using the generic React import path instead of the Next.js-specific one

## Implementation Details

The change corrects the import statement to use the Next.js App Router optimized version:
```typescript
// Before:
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";

// After:
import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next";
```

This ensures proper integration with Next.js's App Router, including built-in route support and framework-specific optimizations.

## Verification

1. ✅ Build completed successfully - no compilation errors
2. ✅ Linter executed - no new errors introduced (only pre-existing warnings)
3. ✅ All static pages generated correctly (10/10 routes)
4. ✅ Package lock file updated from npm install

## Notes

- The `<Analytics />` component placement is optimal: inside `<MantineProvider>` after the main content
- No additional configuration needed - Analytics will work automatically when deployed to Vercel
- The implementation follows the official Vercel documentation best practices for Next.js App Router projects
